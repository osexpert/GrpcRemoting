Use headers to tell what formatter to use? Serializer: BinaryFormatter, MemoryPack, etc.
Use headers to tell what\if compression to use? Compress: Deflate, gzip, etc.

Use separate methods for bidir and unary? So if no callback delegate arguments can use unary.
Why? maybe a bit faster? But not sure.

TODO: try to reproduce mass reset\cancellation hang on client with bidir and dornet client?

grpd-dotnet server hack to close stream on return:

var ctx = context.GetHttpContext();
var http2stream = ctx.Features.Get<IHttp2StreamIdFeature>();
http2stream.GetType().GetMethod("OnEndStreamReceived", System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance).Invoke(http2stream, null);

PS: only seems to work well for native client.
dotnet client at some point hang due to a mass reset problem (also it is a huge overhead here that every call end upm as cancelled)

So...it seems not possible to create a grpc dotnet server that is stable with both native and dotnet client...
Native client and server is always stable. Native server is stable with dotnet client too.

Dotnet client can be made stable with dotnetserver by having server sering a hangup message to the client
and then client call RequestStream.CompleteAsync() before the server call returns.
BUT this does not help when using the native client -> dotnet server, in this case the dot net server still fails.
So native client -> dotnet server seems to be most incompatible and no know hack or workaround here.
